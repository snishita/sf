# Physical simulation for string figure.

## Introduction

String figure is a traditional game with a loop of string played by hooking and/or unhooking strands of the loop from fingers to produce patterns representing certain objects. Following is an instance of the string figure named "Jacob's ladder".

This site shows a method for generating patterns of the string figure using physics simulations.
